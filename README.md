# FilipinoSignLanguageToTextConverterUsingKNN
K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm-based Filipino Sign Language (FSL) to Text Converter through a Portable Flex Sensor Integrated Gloves and Mobile Application

## FSL to Text 
This project develops a glove that captures hand gestures and hand movements using different sensors (flex sensor, gyroscope, accelerometer) and an Android application that uses KNN algorithm to convert sensor data from the gloves into text. The glove is equipped with a bluetooth module to make the transmission of sensor data to the Android application possible. The Android application can only translate 27 characters (letters A-Z and a space) and doesn't cover words or phrases.

## Typing Game
Upon successfully implementing the basic functions of the prototype, an additional feature was added that would help in practicing the use of Filipino Sign Language. This feature is a simple fingerspelling test. The test will be like a touch-typing test, where a keyboard is used to type the words within a limited amount of time and a score is given. The only difference is that, instead of using a keyboard to type, the gloves will be used. The accuracy and speed of fingerspelling will be recorded, and in time, it will show whether the user improves or not.
